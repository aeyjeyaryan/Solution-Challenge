# Solution-Challenge

## SILENT VOICE

This project aims to recognize and interpret Indian Sign Language (ISL) gestures using computer vision and AI. The system utilizes OpenCV for image processing, MediaPipe for hand tracking, and Google's Gemini AI for sign recognition. It processes live hand gestures from a webcam and predicts the corresponding ISL word.

# Features

* Real-Time Sign Language Translation
* Gesture-to-Text Conversion
* NLP-Powered Neural TTS
* Facial Expression Recognition
* Two-Way Communication
* Multi-Language Support
* Interactive Learning Modules
* Customizable Voice and Text Settings
* Offline Mode
* Integration with Messaging Apps

## Installation
Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python installed. Install the required dependencies using:
